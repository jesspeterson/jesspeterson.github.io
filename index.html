            <h2>Backstory:</h2>
        	</header>
            
			<p>When I was five, I took my first cruise and was hooked. I loved crossing oceans, visiting new places, the immensity of the vessels, and the fantasy world inside them. Growing up, my house was filled with mail-ordered cruise brochures. I would memorize deck plans and schedules. My parents joke that I’ve been doing the same job since I was a child, because I’d design my own ships and itineraries.</p>

            <p>In college, I studied history and computer science. I thought I would work in the tech industry, but an internship at Carnival made me realized how much I loved the travel business. Subsequently, I’ve worked at Holland America Line, Windstar Cruises, and Hurtigruten Expeditions (now HX), always in product/itinerary development roles.</p>
